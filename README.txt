There is a basic version commited before 23:59, and an extended version commited now (1:00 am).
I was wondering if the late penalty can only apply to the grade of the extended part.
(e.g. if the basic version can get 70 points, and the latest one can get 90 points,
then my final scores can be 70+ (90-70)*(1-3%)= 89.4 instead of 90*(1-3%)= 87.3
